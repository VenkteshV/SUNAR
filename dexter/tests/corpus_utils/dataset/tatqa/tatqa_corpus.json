Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements.

For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.

Feed cost for fiscal 2019 was $0.415 per dozen, compared to $0.394 per dozen for the prior fiscal year, an increase of 5.3%. The increase in feed costs was primarily related to less favorable crop conditions in the south central U. S., which resulted in higher ingredient prices at some of our larger feed mill operations.

The decrease in the effective tax rate and the decrease in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulted primarily from the combination of a decline in pre-tax earnings and the decrease in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, and the impact of other provisions of the tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Additionally, the Company recorded tax expense of $26.6 million resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in US federal tax rate.

These deliveries resulted in an increase in operating days. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $25.4 million due to the expiration of the initial time charters of the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago and the GasLog Sydney. Following the expiration of their initial charters, the GasLog Shanghai has been trading in the spot market through the Cool Pool, the GasLog Santiago began a new, multi-year charter with Trafigura and the GasLog Sydney began a new 18-month charter with Cheniere. There was also a decrease of $8.4 million due to increased off-hire days for four scheduled dry-dockings in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to only one scheduled dry-docking in the same period of 2017 and a decrease of $0.7 million due to increased off-hire days from the remaining vessels. The average daily hire rate increased from $63,006 for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $68,392 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Furthermore, there was a decrease of $0.3 million in revenues from technical management services mainly due to the decrease in the average number of the managed vessels owned by third parties.", "title": null}, "ad239a4b-a551-42c6-a26c-a8dbb78b7f6c": {"passage": "||Amounts are in thousands of U.S. Dollars|Revenues|Net pool allocation|Voyage expenses and commissions|Vessel operating and supervision costs|Depreciation|General and administrative expenses|Profit from operations|Financial costs|Financial income|Gain/(loss) on derivatives|Share of profit of associates|Total other expenses, net|Profit for the year|Non-controlling interests|Profit attributable to owners of the Group\n|2017||$525,229|7,254|(15,404)|(122,486)|(137,187)|(39,850)|217,556|(139,181)|2,650|2,025|1,159|(133,347)|84,209|68,703|$15,506\nYear ended December 31,|2018||$618,344|17,818|(20,374)|(128,084)|(153,193)|(41,993)|292,518|(166,627)|4,784|(6,077)|1,800|(166,120)|126,398|78,715|$47,683\n|Change||$93,115|10,564|(4,970)|(5,598)|(16,006)|(2,143)|74,962|(27,446)|2,134|(8,102)|641|(32,773)|42,189|10,012|$32,177", "title": null, "type": "table"}, "dbc96518-d0c0-41ab-b3d4-aa2512f617fc": {"passage": "The fair value of the Company's stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes- Merton option-pricing model.

These valuation approaches are dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth rates, our cost of capital, capital expenditures, income tax rates, and other variables. Assumptions used in our valuations were consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. Our discounted cash flows forecast could be negatively impacted by a change in the competitive landscape, any internal decisions to pursue new or different strategies, a loss of a significant customer, or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products.

The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

Previously, the Company deferred revenue and cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributor sold the product to their end customer. As required by the new revenue standard, the Company no longer defers revenue and cost of sales, but rather, estimates the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and records revenue at the time of sale to the distributor.

We believe the gross Federal NOL benefit we generated prior to January 1, 2018 to offset taxable income is less than $150 thousand annually. As prescribed under Internal Revenue Code, any unused Federal NOL benefit from the annual limitation can be accumulated and carried forward to the subsequent year and will expire if not used in accordance with the NOL carried forward term of 20 years or 2037, if generated before 2018 and Federal NOLs generated after 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely.

Non-construction related expenses, such as labor, training and office-related expenses for a facility under construction are recorded as start-up expense until the facility begins operations. As a facility moves closer to actual start-up, the expenses incurred for labor, training, etc. increase. As a result, amounts classified as start-up expenses will increase period over period until the facility begins production. Once production begins, the expenses from that point forward are recorded as costs of goods sold. The decrease in stock compensation expense is the result of the number of shares earned for the performance shares granted on November 1, 2017, being lower as compared to the number of shares earned for the performance shares granted on November 1, 2016.

The Company has applied the new revenue standard to all contracts that were entered into after adoption and to all contracts that were open as of the initial date of adoption. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new standard impacts the Company's net sales on an ongoing basis depending on the relative amount of revenue sold through its distributors, the change in inventory held by its distributors, and the changes in price concessions granted to its distributors. Previously, the Company deferred revenue and cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributor sold the product to their end customer. As required by the new revenue standard, the Company no longer defers revenue and cost of sales, but rather, estimates the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and records revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. Sales to non-distributor customers, under both the previous and new revenue standards, are generally recognized upon the Company\u2019s shipment of the product.
